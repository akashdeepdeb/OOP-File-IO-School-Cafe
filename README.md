# OOP-File-IO-School-Cafe

A project I made in high school. Uses C++, some file handling (I/O) and some bit of object oriented programming. 
It's essentially a cafeteria food program which allows one to save money and optimizes calories. Very simple stuff. Good if you're trying to understand how File Handling works in C++.

*This is project is currently inactive.
